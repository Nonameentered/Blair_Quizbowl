    &nbsp; It's Academic is co-sponsored by social studies teacher David Swaney, who returns after a one-year hiatus,
    and English teacher Phyllis Fleischaker, a newcomer to the club.&nbsp; The pair replaces the husband-wife duo of
    Peter and Angela Engelmann, who had headed the club in 2001-2002.

        <li>Thanks to everyone who came out to the <B>End of Year Academic Dinner</B> on May 17 at the Rockville Pike
            That's
            Amore. We hosted a turnout of 36 people, including students from 5 different clubs. Excess proceeds from the
            dinner
            were dived equally amongst the treasuries of these clubs. To everyone who was in attendance, we hope to see
            you again
            next
            year!</li>
