        <p><br><br>The 2015 High School National Championship Tournament was held in Chicago, Illinois on 5/30 and 5/31. Blair placed <b>13th</b> in a field of 272 teams.
        <br><br>The 2015 PACE National Scholastic Tournament was held in Reston, Virginia on 6/6 and 6/7. Blair placed <b>7th</b> in a field of 96 teams. On the way to this outstanding result, they defeated the eventual runners-up, LASA, in a half-packet.
        <br><br>Notably, despite being ranked just 37th in the Pre-Nationals High School Quiz Bowl Rankings, Blair placed better than both in-state rivals Richard Montgomery (ranked 3rd) and Centennial (ranked 6th) in both national championships. Way to go Blair!</p>
