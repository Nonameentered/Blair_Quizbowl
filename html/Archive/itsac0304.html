            <p>Here are the 2003-2004 season highlights and overviews:</p>

            <p>The It's Academic Team kicked off the new school year with a huge turnout crowd 
            of 41 people for its inagural meeting on <strong>September 9</strong>. We welcomed a number of new 
            faces and returning veterans, including a special guest, alum <strong>Jared Sagoff</strong>. Sagoff 
            was an It's Ac member for the duration of his career at Blair, and was a participant on 
            the It's Academic TV show last year.</p>

            <p>Blair participated in a ten team scrimmage at Walter Johnson on <strong>September 25</strong>.
              Our team of <strong>Jonathan Magin, Ning Bao, Abhi Nargundkar, and Minghui Yang</strong> went 3-1, with 
            decisive victories were posted over Churchill, Gaithersburg, and Richard Montgomery's 'B' 
            team.  Blair's only loss was to Richard Montgomery's 'A' team. </p>

            <p>The first 'real' tournament of the year was held at James Hubert Blake HS on 
            <strong>October 4</strong>. Blair sent two teams to compete. The 'A' team of <strong>
            Ning Bao (C), Jonathan Magin, John Shen, Saul Kinter, and alternate Sam Wight</strong>
             did admirably, going 5-0 to win their division, ultimately losing to Gonzaga in the 
            second round of the playoffs. 'B' Team--<strong>Abhi Nargundkar (C), Neil Agarwal, 
            David White, Justin Kovac, and alternate Sareen Engineer</strong>--got off to a slow 
            start, but won their final 3 games to finish with a strong 3-2 performance. </p>

            <p>Blair sent two teams to the 24-team Keegan tournament at Blake HS on <strong>October 14</strong>. 
            The 'B' team of <strong>Saul Kinter (C), Abhi Nargundkar, Min Wu, Sheila Rajagopal, and Neil Agarwal </strong>
            started off slow but finished strongly, trouncing Wootton in their last match. For the day, 
            they finished with a 4-2 record, good for 10th overall, and narrowly missing a playoff 
            berth. 'A' team of <strong>Ning Bao (C), Jonathan Magin, Martino Choi, and Minghui Yang</strong>
             went 6-0 to earn an invitation to the round-of-8 playoffs held Monday. They defeated 
            Walt Whitman and Banneker to advance to the finals against Richard Montgomery, where 
            they lost a close and tough match. Congratulations to Blair A on their second place finish.</p>

            <p>Blair sent three teams to the <strong>November 15</strong> tournament at Eleanor Roosevelt
             High School in Greenbelt. The 'A' team of <strong>Ning Bao(C), Jon Magin, Abhi Nargundkar, 
            and Saul Kinter</strong> went 5-0 in the regular round and beat Maret C and GDS A to 
            advance to the semifinals against archrival Richard Montgomery 'A'. This game was a nailbite
             that was only resolved three questions from the end, as Blair triumphed to advance to the 
            championship against Gonzaga. This was championship It's Academic at its best, a hard-fought
             struggle that Blair ultimately lost by one question. Although they fell just short of winning
             the whole thing, the 'A' team had a terrific day in taking home the second place trophy. 
            Blair's 'B' team of <strong>Sheila Rajagopal(C), Vivek Chellappa, Justin Kovac, and Doug Adams</strong>
             had a bit of a rough day, going 1-4. This bit of bad luck is not too concerning; 
            B Team will undoubtedly rebound strongly next time. Blair's 'C' Team was the surprise
             story of the day. Composed entirely of underclassmen It's Academic rookies, the C team went
             3-2 to finish second in their division and make the playoffs in their very first tournament
             playing together! They lost to Richard Montgomery A in the playoffs, but nonetheless, a 
            spectacular performance by these up-and-coming stars. All in all, it was an exciting day
             for Blair teams.</p>

             <strong>November 23</strong>.  'A' Team: <strong>Ning Bao(C), Jon Magin, Abhi Nargundkar, and John 
            Silberholz</strong>.  'B' Team: <strong>Sheila Rajagopal(C), Neil Agarwal, Vivek Chellappa,
