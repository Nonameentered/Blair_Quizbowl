<p class=MsoTitle>Rules and Regs to Raise your Team to a Competitive Level</p>

<p class=MsoTitle><i><span style='font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>By
Ning Bao, Class of 2004</span></i><span style='font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoTitle><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Guys, listen up: the last few tournaments have proven that
Blair is capable of fielding not one, but several playoff-contending teams, especially
considering that we were missing more than half of our normal top sixteen
people at the last tournament, and our “C” team still made it to the playoffs.
I believe that any one of our teams has a very valid shot to knock off other
teams, including powerhouses like TJ, Richard Montgomery, and Gonzaga. Any
team’s play can be significantly improved if the team members simply follow a
few of the following rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>Match your buzzing style to the tournament that you are
at. A case in point is the Keegan tournament format at Blake High School versus
the It’s Academic Show format employed at Eleanor Roosevelt. At Keegan’s
tournaments, clues are obviously headed towards answers, so if you have an
idea, buzz aggressively. Chances are that you and someone else on your team can
put the pieces of the puzzle together. Even if you get it wrong, there is no
penalty connected with the questions. At the It’s Academic style of tournament,
buzz more conservatively, as chances to get free points in the team-specific rounds
are plentiful, the questions tend to be a bit longer and harder, and there are
penalties associated with each question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>If you don’t know how a particular tournament is
structured or what its questions tend to emphasize, don’t b afraid to <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>ask.</b> Most upperclassmen members of the
team, especially the members of the A- and B- teams, have been to each
tournament that we will be attending at least once. Their insight is valuable,
and should be sought if needed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>Always confer with your teammates. This prevents your
team from blurting out answers that are wrong in silly ways, such as saying
“Frederick Roosevelt” instead of saying Franklin Roosevelt. Also, whenever
possible, give the least amount of information to make your answer discernable,
i.e. last names, abbreviations, things like that, to prevent the possibility of
making stupid mistakes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>If you take a large margin, (about 8-10 questions
halfway through a 50-question round, say) don’t be afraid to sit on it. At this
point, you should buzz more conservatively, as the closer it gets to the end
the more the other team will become desperate. Let their nerves work for you
for the easy win. Conversely, if you find yourself in the reversed situation,
remember that wins are not the only determiner of whether or not you make the
playoffs. It is better to take a high-point total loss than to gamble
everything on a small chance to win while the possibility for lowering your own
point total is large.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>Know the rest of your team. Learn their strengths and
their weaknesses, and try to remember clues that have tipped them off at
tournaments before. This is especially true for mathematics, as at many
tournaments one person should buzz after all relevant information has been
provided while the person that is strong in math works it out either on paper
or in his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>If you have no idea about a question and you know this
early, jot down basic notes about the question in case your team’s strength in
that subject is distracted during the question. This way, your team can buzz at
any point of the question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>For any non-calculation-oriented question, observe a
“10-second rule.” That is to say, if no one has a clue after ten seconds and
there is a penalty enforced on the question if it is missed, do not throw an
answer out there for the sake of doing so. This stands if you are behind, as
well. As always, exceptions to the rule are left up to the individual captains
of the teams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>Designate an individual as a captain. This person
should the most experienced player out of all the players on a team, because it
is his responsibility to make the snap judgements about what answer to give to
the moderators. If he makes a mistake, don’t jump all over him, as this weakens
team morale and distracts people from the next question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>Listen for subtle verbal cues that give away the answer
to the question, such as “this longest-serving first lady” would obviously be
Eleanor Roosevelt, as her husband was the longest serving president. Often the
person responsible for picking up on the verbal cues is one of the people who
is not actively engaged in trying to answer the question, but rather feeds this
information to the team’s captain or specialist after hearing the subtle
giveaway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>Know your opponents. If your team is playing against a
team from TJ, expect them to be very fast on the math and science questions and
less so on the humanities questions. This does NOT mean that you should try to
outdo the other team at what they are best at. Play within yourselves, stay
close to them in their categories while scoring high in your own is the way to
win the games.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>If the round are timed, as they are on the TV show or
at several other tournaments, learn how to use the clock to your advantage. For
example, if your team is up by 2 questions with 25 seconds left on the clock
and the reader just finished reading the question, you should buzz and wait for
the reader’s verbal prompt before slowly and deliberately enunciating the
syllables of your answer, even if you know that it is wrong. If this shaves off
even 5 seconds off the other team’s time, this could mean the difference
between one question and two, and once again puts the pressure back on the
other team.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>In the playoffs, your team will often be
underestimated, especially if you are listed as Blair B or Blair C. Don’t let
this get you down, but instead consider how much the other team’s morale will
crash if you can take and hold an early lead on them on a couple of good
buzzes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>Captains: trust your specialists in the various areas
that they are responsible for if ever two teammates give you conflicting
answers. Again, final discretion is yours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>If possible, always ask the moderator to tell you the
answer to any unanswered questions in order to prepare for the next tournament.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]><span style='font-family:Symbol;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><![endif]>Finally, guys, it’s a game. A competition. A sport.
Have fun when you are competing, and learn from both what questions you manage
to get, and what the other team gets.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>
