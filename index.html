<p> Welcome to the MBHS Academic Team website.
Trivia buffs, this is the club for you!  Here is a chance to show off your skills against
others who play along with Jeopardy! on TV.  (Just kidding...only a few of us do.)
We regularly play in tournaments against a number of other Maryland, DC, and Virginia area schools.
We are also participants in It's Academic, a quiz show that airs Saturday mornings at 10:30 AM on NBC. <!--You can watch our first game in the 2016-2017 season on December 31st.-->

<br><br>We welcome everyone, regardless of skill level.  You don't have to know who Schuyler
Colfax was, what William Faulkner wrote, or which team has won the most Super Bowls,
but here you'll probably find out.
Come to one of our casual, informal meetings and discover the
wide world of quizbowl for yourself!</p>

<p>Blair's It's Academic team is coached by physics teacher
<strong>James Schafer</strong> and earth science and chemistry teacher <strong>Erik Lodal</strong>.
Meetings are held in <strong>Room 215, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:20-4:20
PM</strong>.
